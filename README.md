# Card_Transaction

Our goal of this project was to predict credit card spending amounts in preparation for COVID-19.<br>
My role was to analyze the difference in the credit card spending patterns before and after COVID-19.<br>
I analyzed the credit transaction data (2019.01 ~ 2020.04) of several GBs provided by the BC card company using MATLAB and Python.<br> 
I also visualized the data by plotting graphs. 

Please refer to the following links if you cannot preview the notebook:<br>
#### Industry: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lee00206/Card_Transaction/blob/master/Industry.ipynb<br>
#### Region: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lee00206/Card_Transaction/blob/master/Region.ipynb<br>
#### Travel: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lee00206/Card_Transaction/blob/master/Travel.ipynb<br><br>

"Industry" shows how the credit card sales have changed after COVID-19 in each industry.<br><br>
"Region" shows how the credit card sales have changed after COVID-19 in each region (there are 17 regions in total).<br><br>
"Travel"shows the change in floating population after COVID-19. It was analyzed by dividing the data into two groups: card transacted by customers from the same region and card transacted by customers from different regions.
Then it shows how the floating population has changed after COVID-19 in each region.<br><br>
"Visualization" produces the following graphs:<br>
+ The monthly amount of credit card transactions<br>
+ Regional / Industrial amount of credit card transactions<br>
+ Comparison between gross sales index and credit card sales<br>
+ The monthly amount of credit card transactions by age group<br>
<Visualization> produces 24 graphs in total.<br>
The followings are the examples of "Visualization":<br>
